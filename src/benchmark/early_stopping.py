class EarlyStopping:
    """
    A custom early stopping class to monitor a validation metric (e.g., validation loss)
    and stop training if the metric does not improve for a specified number of epochs.

    Early stopping is a form of regularization used to avoid overfitting by halting
    training when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving.
