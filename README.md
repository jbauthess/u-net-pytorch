# Torch Semantic Segmentation
The goal of this project is to implement main semantic segmentation models using pytorch and to propose tools to easily train and evaluate those models. 

## Installation

pytorch library may depend of your computer configuration. Before running installation using poetry,
you must edit pyproject.toml to specify a valid pytorch source. 
```
[[tool.poetry.source]]
name = "pytorch-gpu-source"
url = SET YOUR URL HERE
priority = "explicit"
```
The adequat url can be generated by specifying your configuration here:
